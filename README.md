# MinPl

A minimal implemetation of Prolog programming language.
It only implements basic proof search and unification.

In particular has none of those (but I may add in the future):

- Lists;
- Built in numbers;
- Built in predicates;
- Cuts;
- DFGs;
- etc.

### Usage

To load a database and run a REPL where you can ask queries:

```
cargo run <prolog_database_file>
```
